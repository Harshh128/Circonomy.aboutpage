            Ready to tackle
            <br> today's challenge
        </h2></section>
        <p>
            Circonomy was created in 2023 when Adrien & KK first met at Antler and realised they were driven by the same passion to create a startup that will fight against the climate crisis for the people and the planet. 
<br><br>
Open burning is a harmful practice that emits toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases, contributing to climate change and damaging human health. Smallholder farmers in India and Southeast Asia are particularly affected by this practice.
            <br><br>
To fight against it, we need to promote more sustainable practices like converting agricultural waste into biochar. Biochar can sequester carbon, improve soil health, and increase crop yields, making it a valuable solution for smallholder farmers.
It's essential to act now and scale up these practices to meet the Paris Agreement target of limiting global warming to below 1,5 degrees Celsius. By doing so, we can mitigate the negative impacts of climate change and promote sustainable agriculture in India and Southeast Asia.
